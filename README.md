# Medical-Diagnosis-BayesNets-Project
Languages: Python with pgmpy
This project, I will be analyzing medical diagnosis using Bayes Nets. The structure and the Conditional Probabability Distribution tables are shown in the figure below.

### Situation
A drug company would like to introduce a drug to help patients with Alzheimer's. It is desirable to estimate  θ , the proportion of the market share that this drug will capture.

The company interviews 100 people and 15 of them say that they will buy the drug. (This the observed data: n=100, observed=15)  −>  likelihood
If in the past new drugs tend to capture a proportion between say .10 and .40 of the market, and if all values in between are assumed equally likely, then  θ∼𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑓(0.10,0.40)   −>  prior
